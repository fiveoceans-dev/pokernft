# TODO

The following items from the implementation checklist remain unfinished:

- Deterministic PRNG with logged seed and per-hand hash for audits.
- Log rake taken from pots.
- Comprehensive hand and action logging for replay and tests.
- Unit tests covering:
  - Min-raise reopen scenarios.
  - Side pots with three or more all-ins.
  - Dead-blind returns.
